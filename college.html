		<p style="background-color:black; color:white; font-size:14pt">Early in <b>1964</b>, the enlightened public of Kanhangad and Nileshwar resolved to honour the memory of <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b>, the architect of modern India by undertaking educational and cultural activities in this educationally backward area. In pursuit of this idea, a dedicated and learned team set up in 1966, an educational society known as <b>"The Nehru Memorial Education Society" </b>under the distinguished presidentship of the <i><b>late Shri. C. K. Nair</b></i> following which the society was duly registered. The establishment of Nehru Arts & Science College, Kanhangad in this backward coastal tract was the major task the society had set before themselves and had subsequently accomplished it.The society acquired a plot of 30 acres at Padnekkad and applied for affiliation to the University of Kerala for a junior college in the locality. The foundation stone of the college building was laid on <b>1st April 1968</b> by <i><b>Late Janab. C. H. Mohammed Koya,</b></i>The Minister for Education, Kerala while in office. Meanwhile, the area came under the territorial jurisdiction of the Calicut University, to which the college was affiliated. First year Pre-Degree classes commenced on 14th August 1968. The college was upgraded in 1972. Presently, the college is affiliated to Kannur Univeristy.
